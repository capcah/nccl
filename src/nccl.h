 * using ncclGroupStart and ncclGroupEnd. ncclGroupStart will enqueue all
 * collective calls until the ncclGroupEnd call, which will wait for all calls
 * to be complete. Note that for collective communication, ncclGroupEnd only
 * guarantees that the operations are enqueued on the streams, not that
 * the operation is effectively done.
 *
 * Both collective communication and ncclCommInitRank can be used in conjunction
 * of ncclGroupStart/ncclGroupEnd.
